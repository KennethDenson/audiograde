## Obtaining Your Plex Token

To use this application, you'll need your Plex token. Here's how to find it:

### Method 1: Using Browser Developer Tools

1. Sign in to the Plex Web App ([app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv))
2. Play any media file
3. Right-click anywhere and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
4. Go to the "Network" tab in the developer tools
5. Refresh the page
6. Look for any request to your Plex server
7. Find the `X-Plex-Token` parameter in the URL
   - It will look something like `?X-Plex-Token=abcdef123456789`

### Method 2: Using Plex Settings (XML Method)

1. Sign in to the Plex Web App ([app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv))
2. Click on the settings icon (top right)
3. Select any server from the left sidebar
4. Add `/manage` to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar and press Enter
5. You'll be redirected to the server management interface
6. Click the three dots menu (â‹®) at the top right
7. Choose "View XML"
8. In the URL of the XML page, you'll find `X-Plex-Token=` followed by your token

## Finding Your Plex Server URL

1. **Local Access**: 
   - Your Plex server typically runs on port 32400
   - The URL format is usually `http://IP_ADDRESS:32400`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:32400`

2. **Remote Access**: 
   - If you have remote access enabled, you can use `https://your-server-name.plex.direct:32400`
   - Note that remote access requires additional security considerations

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **"Failed to connect to Plex server"**
   - Verify your server URL is correct
   - Ensure your Plex server is running
   - Check if your token is valid and hasn't expired

2. **CORS Errors**
   - If using a hosted version, ensure your Plex server has appropriate CORS headers enabled
   - For local development, CORS issues are typically handled by the development server

### No Albums Found

1. **"No album found. There might not be any unrated albums."**
   - Adjust the threshold settings to be less restrictive
   - Check if you have any unrated tracks in your library
   - Verify you're connected to the correct library

## Security Notes

- This application stores your Plex token in your browser's localStorage
- Always use this application on a secure device and network
- Consider removing the token from localStorage when you're done using the app
- Never share your Plex token with others

## Testing

This project includes comprehensive tests for both components and services:

```
npm test
```

To run tests with coverage reporting:

```
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Technical Details

### Stack

- React for the user interface
- Jest and React Testing Library for testing
- CSS3 with CSS variables for theming
- Lucide React for icons

### Architecture

- `PlexService.js` - Service for interacting with the Plex API
- `App.js` - Main React component
- Local storage for persisting user preferences and connection details

### Fixes

- **Icon Display Issue**: If icons are not displaying correctly, ensure that `app.css` is imported in `src/index.js` to load Tailwind and custom styles. This resolves issues with icon sizing and color-utility rules.

## Future Improvements

- Support for Plex SSO login instead of token authentication
- Mobile app version with React Native
- Integration with additional metadata providers
- Batch rating functionality
- Export/import of ratings

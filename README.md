## Obtaining Your Plex Token

To use this application, you'll need your Plex token. Here's how to find it:

### Method 1: Using Browser Developer Tools

1. Sign in to the Plex Web App ([app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv))
2. Play any media file
3. Right-click anywhere and select "Inspect" or "Inspect Element"
4. Go to the "Network" tab in the developer tools
5. Refresh the page
6. Look for any request to your Plex server
7. Find the `X-Plex-Token` parameter in the URL
   - It will look something like `?X-Plex-Token=abcdef123456789`

### Method 2: Using Plex Settings (XML Method)

1. Sign in to the Plex Web App ([app.plex.tv](https://app.plex.tv))
2. Click on the settings icon (top right)
3. Select any server from the left sidebar
4. Add `/manage` to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar and press Enter
5. You'll be redirected to the server management interface
6. Click the three dots menu (‚ãÆ) at the top right
7. Choose "View XML"
8. In the URL of the XML page, you'll find `X-Plex-Token=` followed by your token

## Finding Your Plex Server URL

1. **Local Access**: 
   - Your Plex server typically runs on port 32400
   - The URL format is usually `http://IP_ADDRESS:32400`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:32400`
2. **Remote Access**: 
   - If you have remote access enabled, you can use `https://your-server-name.plex.direct:32400`
   - Note that remote access requires additional security considerations

## Usage

### Connecting to Plex

1. Launch the application
2. Enter your Plex server URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:32400`)
3. Enter your Plex authentication token
4. Click "Connect to Plex"

### Rating Albums

1. Once connected, the app shows an album with unrated tracks
2. Click on the stars (1-5) next to each track to rate it
3. Ratings are saved automatically
4. Click "Next Album" to load another album with unrated tracks

### Customizing Album Selection

1. Click the gear icon in the top right to open Settings
2. Choose your music library if you have multiple
3. Select how to filter albums:
   - By percentage of unrated tracks (e.g., show albums with at least 50% unrated tracks)
   - By count of unrated tracks (e.g., show albums with at least 3 unrated tracks)
4. Click "Save Settings" to apply your changes

### Resetting the App

If you need to reset your settings or change your Plex server:
1. Navigate to `/reset.html` in your browser
2. Click "Reset All Settings"
3. You'll be returned to the login screen

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

1. **"Failed to connect to Plex server"**
   - Verify your server URL is correct
   - Ensure your Plex server is running
   - Check if your token is valid and hasn't expired
2. **CORS Errors**
   - If using a hosted version, ensure your Plex server has appropriate CORS headers enabled
   - For local development, CORS issues are typically handled by the development server

### No Albums Found

1. **"No album found. There might not be any unrated albums."**
   - Adjust the threshold settings to be less restrictive
   - Check if you have any unrated tracks in your library
   - Verify you're connected to the correct library
